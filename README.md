# Handling-Extremely-Large-Images
Loading Extremely Large Images e.g. 100000x100000 is an issue when need to load them, preprocess, and train a Deep Learning model. 
Also, common resizing tools like cv2 lead to huge info loss being slow and unable to resize in such scales. 
In this project we aim to provide a viable solution and adress these issues.
We also provide an optimization way for accelerating the resizing procedure time for such images.
